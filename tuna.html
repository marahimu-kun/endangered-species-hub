        <h2>About the Bluefin Tuna</h2>
        <p>
          The Bluefin Tuna is a highly prized species known for its massive size
          and value in the global fish market, particularly in the sushi
          industry. Overfishing, habitat degradation, and illegal fishing
          practices have drastically reduced its population, pushing it to the
          brink of extinction. The Bluefin Tuna is considered Critically
          Endangered.
        </p>

        <h3>Scientific Classification</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> Animalia</li>
          <li><strong>Phylum:</strong> Chordata</li>
          <li><strong>Class:</strong> Actinopterygii</li>
          <li><strong>Order:</strong> Perciformes</li>
          <li><strong>Family:</strong> Scombridae</li>
          <li><strong>Genus:</strong> Thunnus</li>
          <li><strong>Species:</strong> Thunnus thynnus</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Habitat and Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          Bluefin Tuna are found in the North Atlantic Ocean and the
          Mediterranean Sea. They are migratory, traveling vast distances to
          breed and find food. These powerful swimmers are highly adapted to
          life in the open ocean, relying on abundant prey such as smaller fish
          and squid.
        </p>

        <h3>Threats to Survival</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Overfishing:</strong> Bluefin Tuna are heavily targeted by
            commercial fisheries for their high value in international markets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Illegal Fishing:</strong> Despite conservation efforts,
            illegal and unregulated fishing continues to threaten the species.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Habitat Destruction:</strong> Pollution and changes in ocean
            conditions are affecting the tuna's migration patterns and food
            sources.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conservation Efforts</h3>
        <p>
          Several initiatives have been launched to protect the Bluefin Tuna,
          including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Strict fishing quotas and regulations to limit catch numbers.</li>
          <li>
            Efforts to combat illegal fishing through improved monitoring and
            enforcement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Promotion of sustainable fishing practices to protect the species'
            long-term viability.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Bluefin Tuna can reach lengths of up to 10 feet (3 meters) and weigh
            over 1,000 pounds (450 kg).
          </li>
          <li>
            They are among the fastest fish in the ocean, capable of swimming at
            speeds of up to 75 km/h (47 mph).
          </li>
          <li>
            Bluefin Tuna have a unique ability to regulate their body
            temperature, allowing them to survive in colder waters.
