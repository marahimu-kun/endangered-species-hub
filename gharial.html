        <h2>About the Gharial</h2>
        <p>
          The Gharial, also known as the Indian crocodile, is a large
          crocodilian found primarily in the rivers of the Indian subcontinent.
          They are known for their long, narrow snout, which is uniquely adapted
          to catching fish. Despite being a fierce predator, they are critically
          endangered due to habitat loss, hunting, and pollution.
        </p>

        <h3>Scientific Classification</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> Animalia</li>
          <li><strong>Phylum:</strong> Chordata</li>
          <li><strong>Class:</strong> Reptilia</li>
          <li><strong>Order:</strong> Crocodylia</li>
          <li><strong>Family:</strong> Gavialidae</li>
          <li><strong>Genus:</strong> Gavialis</li>
          <li><strong>Species:</strong> Gavialis gangeticus</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Habitat and Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          Gharials are found primarily in the river systems of India, Nepal, and
          Bhutan, preferring deep, fast-flowing rivers with sandy banks. Their
          habitat is being destroyed by dam construction, river pollution, and
          human settlements.
        </p>

        <h3>Threats to Survival</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Habitat Destruction:</strong> Dams, river pollution, and
            human settlements disrupt their habitat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Poaching:</strong> Gharials are hunted for their skin and
            eggs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fishing Nets:</strong> They often get trapped in fishing
            nets, leading to injury or death.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conservation Efforts</h3>
        <p>Several initiatives are underway to save the Gharial, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Establishing protected areas and sanctuaries for breeding.</li>
          <li>Monitoring populations through surveys and studies.</li>
          <li>Working with local communities to reduce human impact.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Gharials can live up to 50 years in the wild.</li>
          <li>
            They primarily eat fish and are known for their excellent swimming
            ability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Their long snouts help them catch fish more efficiently than other
            crocodilians.
          </li>
