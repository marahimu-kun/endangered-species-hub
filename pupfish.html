        <h2>About the Devilâ€™s Hole Pupfish</h2>
        <p>
          The Devilâ€™s Hole Pupfish is one of the rarest fish in the world,
          living in a single, deep, groundwater-fed cavern in Nevada, USA. Due
          to its extremely limited habitat and its small population, it is
          classified as Critically Endangered.
        </p>

        <h3>Scientific Classification</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> Animalia</li>
          <li><strong>Phylum:</strong> Chordata</li>
          <li><strong>Class:</strong> Actinopterygii</li>
          <li><strong>Order:</strong> Cyprinodontiformes</li>
          <li><strong>Family:</strong> Cyprinodontidae</li>
          <li><strong>Genus:</strong> Cyprinodon</li>
          <li><strong>Species:</strong> Cyprinodon diabolis</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Habitat and Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          The Devilâ€™s Hole Pupfish is found only in Devilâ€™s Hole, a deep,
          isolated cavern located in Nevadaâ€™s Ash Meadows, part of the Mojave
          Desert. The water in Devilâ€™s Hole is warm, and its ecosystem is
          fragile due to its small size and sensitivity to changes in water
          levels.
        </p>

        <h3>Threats to Survival</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Water Level Fluctuations:</strong> The population is highly
            sensitive to changes in water levels, which have been caused by both
            natural events and human activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Climate Change:</strong> Rising temperatures and changes in
            precipitation patterns threaten the aquatic ecosystem where the
            pupfish lives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Habitat Degradation:</strong> Groundwater extraction and
            land development pose significant risks to the stability of the
            habitat.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conservation Efforts</h3>
        <p>Conservation efforts for the Devilâ€™s Hole Pupfish include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Protection of its unique habitat through regulations on groundwater
            use and development.
          </li>
          <li>
            Monitoring and research to better understand the species' needs and
            improve its chances of survival.
          </li>
          <li>
            Efforts to maintain stable water levels and prevent significant
            fluctuations.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Devilâ€™s Hole Pupfish is one of the rarest species in the world,
            with fewer than 100 individuals remaining in the wild.
          </li>
          <li>
            They are highly adapted to living in the warm, stable environment of
            the deep, groundwater-fed cave.
          </li>
          <li>
            Due to their extremely small population, they are often subject to
            genetic bottlenecking, which can reduce their genetic diversity.
