        <h2>About the Monarch Butterfly</h2>
        <p>
          The Monarch Butterfly is a remarkable species known for its incredible
          long-distance migration and its striking orange and black wings. Once
          abundant across North America, its population has declined sharply,
          leading to its classification as Endangered.
        </p>

        <h3>Scientific Classification</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> Animalia</li>
          <li><strong>Phylum:</strong> Arthropoda</li>
          <li><strong>Class:</strong> Insecta</li>
          <li><strong>Order:</strong> Lepidoptera</li>
          <li><strong>Family:</strong> Nymphalidae</li>
          <li><strong>Genus:</strong> Danaus</li>
          <li><strong>Species:</strong> Danaus plexippus</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Habitat and Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          Monarch Butterflies are found primarily in North and South America.
          They breed in the United States and Canada, migrating to Mexico during
          the winter months. Their primary habitat includes open fields,
          meadows, and areas with abundant milkweed plants.
        </p>

        <h3>Threats to Survival</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Habitat Loss:</strong> Urbanization and agriculture have led
            to a decrease in the habitats where Monarchs breed and feed,
            particularly the loss of milkweed plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pesticides:</strong> The widespread use of pesticides harms
            Monarch populations by killing both adult butterflies and larvae.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Climate Change:</strong> Changes in weather patterns,
            including droughts and temperature fluctuations, disrupt the
            migration and survival of Monarchs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conservation Efforts</h3>
        <p>Conservation efforts to protect Monarch Butterflies include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Efforts to restore milkweed habitats in key areas along migration
            routes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reducing pesticide use and promoting organic farming practices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collaborative initiatives between governments, conservation
            organizations, and local communities to protect breeding and
            migratory sites.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Monarch Butterflies are famous for their incredible migration,
            traveling thousands of miles from North America to central Mexico.
          </li>
          <li>
            The butterflies' migration is one of the most well-documented
            natural phenomena, with some Monarchs traveling over 3,000 miles
            each year.
          </li>
          <li>
            The distinctive orange and black wings are a warning to predators
            that the butterfly is toxic due to the milkweed they consume during
            their larvae stage.
